[STEP 4] LLM RESPONSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response Time: 2.49 seconds
Response Length: 639 characters
Success: True

FULL RESPONSE:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about flights originating from ORD (O'Hare International Airport). The context only provides data about various journey IDs, passenger satisfaction, and arrival delays.

However, we can see from the semantic matches that some flights have significant arrival delays. For example, Journey ID F_693 had an arrival delay of 115 minutes, and Journey ID F_260 had an arrival delay of 145 minutes.

If you'd like to know more about flights with delays from a specific airport, I would recommend checking the airline's flight schedule or database for more detailed information.

Response Time: 5.25 seconds
Response Length: 477 characters
Success: True

FULL RESPONSE:
Based on the provided context, flights delayed more than 1 hour can be identified by the 'Arrival Delay' metric. 

According to the summary, the average arrival delay is 117.2 minutes, which is equivalent to 1 hour and 57.2 minutes.

From the semantic matches, two journeys had arrival delays exceeding 1 hour:
- Journey ID: F_693 ( Arrival Delay: 115 minutes)
- Journey ID: F_487 ( Arrival Delay: 196 minutes)

These flights met the criteria of being delayed more than 1 hour.
