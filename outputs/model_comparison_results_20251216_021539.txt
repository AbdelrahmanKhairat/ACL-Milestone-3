- **Journey ID: F_941** (Route: SIX → SFX, Flight: 3, Passenger: Millennial, non-elite loyalty)  
  - Food Satisfaction: 2/5 (slightly better than the others listed)  
  
These flights exhibit poor food satisfaction, indicating potential issues with service quality.

**Openai** (✅, 2.02s):
> **Flights that show “terrible” food (Food Satisfaction = 1 / 5)**    
  
| Journey ID | Route (origin → destination) | Aircraft | Arrival Delay | Distance (mi) | Legs |  
|------------|------------------------------|----------|--------------|---------------|------|  
| F_301      | DEX → LAX                    | B737‑800 | –17 min      | 862           | 1 |  
| F_294      | SBX → LAX                    | ERJ‑175  | –16 min      | 156           | 1 |

| F_2608     | LIX → IAX                    | B757‑200 | –13 min      | 3 592         | 1 |  
| F_2504     | SFX → IAX                    | B777

**Llama** (✅, 6.33s):
> Based on the provided CONTEXT, flights with terrible food and poor service are those with a food satisfaction score of 1/5.   
  
From the EXACT MATCHES, we can see that most of the flights with a food satisfaction score of 1/5 have an arrival delay, but the delay is not necessarily long.   
  
Here are some examples:  
  
- Flight F_301 (Route: DEX → LAX, Flight: 441 (B737-800)) had an arrival delay of -17 minutes, but the food satisfaction was only 1/5.  
- Flight F_294 (Route: SBX → LAX, Flight: 5898 (ERJ-175)) had an arrival delay of -16 minutes, and the food satisfaction was also 1/5.  
- Flight F_396 (Route: DEX → LAX, Flight: 680 (B737-900)) had an arrival delay of -17 minutes, and the food satisfaction was 1/5.  
- Flight F_396 (Route: PWX → LAX, Flight: 680 (B737-900)) also had an arrival delay of -17 minutes, and the food satisfaction was 1/5.  
  
From the SEMANTIC MATCHES, we can see that Flight F_434 (Route: SFX → SIX, Flight: 2 (B787-9)) had a food satisfaction score of 1/5, but the arrival delay was 63 minutes.  
  
In summary, flights with terrible food and poor service (food satisfaction score of 1/5) may have varying arrival delays, from -17 minutes to 63 minutes.

### Q5: What are the most comfortable flights?

**Qwen** (✅, 2.09s):
> Based on the provided data, the most comfortable flights appear to be:  
  
1. **Journey ID: F_531**  
   - Route: IAX → LAX  
   - Flight: 1878 (B777-200)  
   - Food Satisfaction: 3/5  
   - Arrival Delay: -16 minutes  
  
2. **Journey ID: F_113**  
   - Route: IAX → LAX  
   - Flight: 797 (B737-900)  
   - Food Satisfaction: 5/5  
   - Arrival Delay: -33 minutes  
  
3. **Journey ID: F_509**  
   - Route: IAX → LAX  
   - Flight: 797 (B737-900)  
   - Food Satisfaction: 4/5  
   - Arrival Delay: -28 minutes  
  
These flights have high food satisfaction scores and early arrivals, which are indicators of a more comfortable experience for passengers.

**Openai** (✅, 1.69s):
> **Most comfortable flights (based on the highest food‑satisfaction rating of 5 / 5):**  
  
| Journey ID | Route | Aircraft / Flight | Food Satisfaction | Arrival Delay | Distance | Legs |  
|------------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|------|  
| **F_1176** | DEX → LAX | B737‑800 / 441 | **5 / 5** | +9 min | 862 mi | 2 |  
| **F_113**  | IAX → LAX | B737‑900 / 797 | **5 / 5** | –33 min | 2 066 mi | 1 |  
  
These two journeys have the only 5‑out‑of‑5 food‑satisfaction scores in the provided data, indicating the highest level of passenger comfort among the listed flights.

**Llama** (✅, 4.76s):
> Based on the provided context, I don't have a direct metric to measure the comfort of flights. However, I can suggest that flights with fewer arrival delays and higher food satisfaction may be considered more comfortable.  
  
Looking at the data, flights F_113 and F_509 have the highest food satisfaction scores (5/5 and 4/5 respectively) and minimal arrival delays (-33 minutes and -28 minutes respectively). These flights also have shorter distances (2066 miles) and fewer legs (1 leg each).  
  
Another consideration is the passenger class. Economy passengers on flights F_113 and F_509 have high food satisfaction scores, suggesting that these flights may be more comfortable for passengers in this class.  
  
It's essential to note that comfort is subjective and can depend on various factors, including personal preferences and expectations. The data provided does not allow for a definitive ranking of the most comfortable flights.  
  
If we consider arrival delay as a factor, flights F_531 and F_110 have the lowest arrival delays (-16 minutes and -13 minutes respectively). However, this alone may not be a sufficient indicator of comfort.  
  
To provide a more comprehensive answer, additional data points such as passenger feedback on seat comfort, in-flight amenities, and overall travel experience would be necessary.  
  
Therefore, based on the available data, I suggest flights F_113 and F_509 as potentially more comfortable options, but with the understanding that comfort is a complex and subjective metric.

### Q6: Show me journeys with good food but long delays

**Qwen** (✅, 1.79s):
> Based on the provided data, there are no journeys that have both good food satisfaction (4/5 or 5/5) and long delays (over 400 minutes).   
  
The journey with the highest food satisfaction rating of 4/5 is F_1154, but it has a delay of only 327 minutes.  
  
The journey with the highest food satisfaction rating of 5/5 is F_474, but it has a delay of only 201 minutes.  
  
The journey with the longest delay of 880 minutes is F_2605, but the food satisfaction for this journey is only 2/5.  
  
Therefore, I don't have sufficient data to show journeys with good food but long delays.

**Openai** (✅, 1.93s):
> 

**Llama** (✅, 4.41s):
> Based on the provided CONTEXT, I found the following journeys with good food (Food Satisfaction >= 4/5) but long delays (Arrival Delay >= 200 minutes):  
  
1. Journey ID: F_2575 (Route: DFX → EWX, Flight: 1835, Arrival Delay: 233 minutes, Food Satisfaction: 4/5)  
2. Journey ID: F_487 (Route: EWX → PBX, Flight: 532, Arrival Delay: 196 minutes, Food Satisfaction: 5/5) (Note: Although this journey has a delay less than 200 minutes, I included it in the list as it meets the 'good food' criteria)  
3. Journey ID: F_474 (Route: GSX → DEX, Flight: 5516, Arrival Delay: 201 minutes, Food Satisfaction: 5/5)  
  
These journeys meet the specified criteria.
