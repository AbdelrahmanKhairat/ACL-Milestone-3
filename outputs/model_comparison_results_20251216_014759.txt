### Q3: Find economy class flights from JFK to LAX

**Qwen** (✅, 1.21s):
> I don't have sufficient data to answer this question. The provided journey information includes flights from JFX (which is likely JFK) to LAX, but no exact matches for flights from JFK to LAX. Specifically, the matching journeys are from JFX to LAX with the following flight numbers: 518, 516, and 515.

**Openai** (✅, 0.94s):
> I don't have sufficient data to answer this question.

**Llama** (✅, 3.22s):
> Unfortunately, I don't have sufficient data to answer this question specifically about flights from JFK to LAX. The provided CONTEXT contains flights from JFX (JFK is not mentioned) to LAX, with a different origination airport (JFX). However, I can provide some relevant information related to flights from similar airports.  
  
Among the results, I found two flights from JFX to LAX:  
  
1. Result 1: Journey ID F_3000, Route JFX → LAX, Flight 518 (B757-200)  
2. Result 2: Journey ID F_1336, Route JFX → LAX, Flight 516 (B757-200)  
3. Result 3: Journey ID F_939, Route JFX → LAX, Flight 516 (B757-200)  
4. Result 5 is not a direct flight from JFX to LAX, but from SJX to LAX.  
  
To find flights from JFK to LAX, I would need more specific information or data about these flights.

### Q4: Flights with terrible food and poor service

**Qwen** (✅, 4.79s):
> Based on the provided data, several flights had very low food satisfaction scores of 1/5. Here are specific examples:  
  
1. **Journey ID: F_396**  
   - Route: EWX → LAX  
   - Flight: 680 (B737-900)  
   - Passenger Class: Economy  
   - Passenger: Boomer, non-elite loyalty (Locator: M1XXS6)

3. **Journey ID: F_1988**  
   - Route: SFX → CDX  
   - Flight: 991 (B777-200)  
   - Passenger Class: Economy

   - Passenger Class: Economy  
   - Passenger: Gen X, non-elite loyalty (Locator: DHXX1T)  
   - Food Satisfaction: 1/5  
   - Arrival Delay: 104 minutes  
   - Similarity Score: 0.808  
  
5. **Journey ID: F_941**  
   - Route: SIX → SFX  
   - Flight: 3 (B787-9)  
   - Passenger Class: Economy  
   - Passenger: Millennial, non-elite loyalty (Locator: C7XX8C)  
   - Food Satisfaction: 2/5  
   - Arrival Delay: 42 minutes  
   - Similarity Score: 0.803  
  
These flights had poor food satisfaction, indicating issues with the food service quality.

**Openai** (✅, 1.93s):
> **Flights that show both terrible food (Food Satisfaction = 1 / 5) and signs of poor service (late arrival)**    
  
| Journey ID | Route | Aircraft | Food Sat. | Arrival Delay | Notes |  
|------------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|-------|  
| **F_1945** | EWX → LAX | B787‑10 | 1/5 | **+13 min** | Single‑leg economy trip |  
| **F_692**  | ORX → DEX | B777‑200 | 1/5 | **+81 min** | 3‑leg journey |  
| **F_315**  | SFX → CDX | B777‑200 | 1/5 | **+111 min** | 2‑leg journey |  
| **F_561**  | SFX

**Llama** (✅, 4.53s):
> Based on the provided CONTEXT, flights with "terrible food" and "poor service" seem to be those with very low food satisfaction ratings.   
  
In the exact matches section, we can see that 15 out of 20 journeys have a food satisfaction rating of 1/5. These journeys are:  
  
* F_301, F_294, F_396 (twice), F_396 (third instance), F_2448, F_188, F_2608, F_2504, F_2829, F_1876, F_56, F_2041, F_2685, F_692, F_315, F_561, F_1147, F_1988  
  
These flights all have a food satisfaction rating of 1/5, indicating poor food quality. However, it's essential to note that a low food satisfaction rating does not necessarily mean "poor service" as the question implies.   
  
There is no explicit metric for "poor service" in the provided data. However, we can infer that flights with a low food satisfaction rating might also have other issues, such as long delays or other passenger complaints.   
  
To get a better understanding of flights with poor service, we would need additional data or metrics.
